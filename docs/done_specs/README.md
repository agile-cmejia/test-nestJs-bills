# ✅ Done Specs Archive

This directory contains **completed specs** that have been fully implemented and verified.

## Purpose

Keep the active `specs/` folder clean by archiving completed work here.

## When to Archive

Move specs here when:
- All stories in the epic are marked `passes: true`
- Code has been reviewed and merged
- Documentation has been updated

## Naming Convention

Preserve original filename with completion date:
- `2026-02-02-completed-user-authentication.json`

## Benefits

1. **Clean workspace** - Active specs folder stays focused
2. **Historical record** - Track what was built and when
3. **Reference material** - Learn from past implementations
4. **Audit trail** - Know who built what

## Note

Archived specs should NOT be modified. They serve as historical record.
