# 📋 PRD Directory

This directory contains **Product Requirements Documents** for features and epics.

## Purpose

PRDs define the "what" and "why" of a feature before breaking it down into atomic stories.

## Structure

Each PRD should include:

1. **Overview** - What is the feature?
2. **Goals** - What problem does it solve?
3. **User Stories** - High-level user needs
4. **Requirements** - Specific requirements (functional & non-functional)
5. **Out of Scope** - What is explicitly NOT included
6. **Success Metrics** - How do we measure success?

## Naming Convention

Use descriptive names with date prefix:
- `2026-02-02-user-authentication.md`
- `2026-02-02-payment-integration.md`

## Workflow

1. Create PRD in this folder
2. Break down into atomic stories in `../stories/`
3. Execute via PPRE cycle
4. Archive when complete
