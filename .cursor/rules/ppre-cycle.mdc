# PPRE Execution Cycle

## Phases

1. PRIME: Load story + reference docs.
2. PLAN: Propose implementation and checklist.
3. RESET: Clear context to restore precision.
4. EXECUTE: Implement only the approved plan.

## Kill Switch (Context Reset)

- Always reset between PLAN and EXECUTE.
- Execute with only the plan and the active file context.
- Avoid exploring unrelated files during EXECUTE.

## Non-Negotiables

- No code changes without a PLAN.
- EXECUTE is deterministic; no new scope discovery.
- If new scope is discovered, return to PRIME + PLAN.
