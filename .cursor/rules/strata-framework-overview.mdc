# Strata Dev Framework Overview

## Mission

We do not just ship code; we architect the system that ships the code.

## Core Principle: Disk-Based Brain

- Do not rely on chat history; move intelligence into files.
- Every fix must leave the system smarter than before.
- If a bug is fixed in code, it must be codified in documentation.

## Context Architecture

- Constitution: `.cursor/rules/global.mdc` (immutable laws, < 200 lines).
- Reference docs: `docs/reference/*.md` (context sharding, load only what is needed).
- Fractal memory: `src/**/agents.md` (local lessons, gotchas, conventions).
- Input contract: `docs/specs/stories.json` (atomic tasks with binary criteria).

## Golden Rule (System Evolution)

When a bug occurs or an agent gets stuck:

1. Fix the code.
2. Codify the lesson in a Markdown file:
   - Logic error -> `src/**/agents.md`
   - Style error -> `.cursor/rules/global.mdc`
   - Process error -> `docs/reference/workflow.md`

## Mandatory

If you fix a bug manually and do not update a `.md` file, the protocol fails.
